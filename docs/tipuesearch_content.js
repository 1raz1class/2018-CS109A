This course is the first half of a one‐year introduction to data science. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. The material of the course is divided 3 modules. Each module will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably; exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; prediction or statistical learning; and communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Only one of CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a for credit. Course Logistics Prerequisites You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above (Stat 110 recommended). HW0 is designed to test your knowledge on the prerequisites. Successful completion of this assignment will show that this course is suitable for you. HW0 will not be graded but you are required to submit. Course Components Lectures The class consists of two weekly lectures. Lectures are held Mon and Wed 1:30pm ‐ 2:45 pm in Northwest Building (NW), Lecture Hall B-103. Attendance to lectures is mandatory for FAS students. DCE students can view the recorded lectures within 2 days. We will have in class quizzes to assess your understanding of the material and to help us identify gaps. Labs Labs are designed as hands-on in-class activities.. The instructor will go over practice problems similar to the homework problems and review difficult material. Attendance to labs is optional but strongly encouraged . Two lab sessions with identical content are held Thur 4:30-6:00 pm and Fri 10:30-11:45 am in Pierce 301 . You should plan to attend one of the two. Sections Lectures and labs are supplemented by 1 hour sections led by teaching fellows. There are two types of sections: a) Standard Sections : which will be a mix of review of material and practice problems similar to the HW b) Advanced Sections which will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and lab and extensions of those methods. The material covered in the Advanced Sections is required for all AC 209A students. Instructor Office Hours Pavlos : Monday 3-5pm, IACS lobby Kevin : Monday 3-5pm, IACS lobby Assignments There will be an initial self-assessment homework called HW0 and 9 more graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due in a week and some of them in two weeks. You have the option to work and submit in pairs for all the assignments except two which you will do individually. You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks which you can run in your own environment or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud ( details on this to come ). Quizzes Quizzes will be taken at the end of class and the material will be based on what was discussed in lecture. DCE students will have 72 hours to complete the quizzes. 40% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade. Final Project There will be a final group project (2-4 students) due during Exams period. See Calendar for specific dates. Recording Lectures will be recorded and made available real time for DCE students and 24 hours later for in-campus students via Canvas. Labs will be videotaped only for distant students. Recommended Textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani. The book is available here: Free electronic version : http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ (Links to an external site). HOLLIS : http://link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7 Amazon : https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370 (Links to an external site) . Course Policies Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, JupyterHub, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: Post the question in Piazza and hopefully your peers will answer. Note that in Piazza questions are visible to everyone. The TFs monitor the posts. Go to Office Hours , this is the best way to get help. For private matters send an email to the Helpline: cs109a2018@gmail.com. The Helpline is monitored by TFs. For personal and confidential matters send an email to the instructors . Grading Guidelines and Regrading Policy Homework will be graded based on 1) how correct your code is (the Notebook cells should run, we are not troubleshooting code), 2) how you have interpreted the results - we want text not just code, it should be a report, and 3) how well you present the results. The scale is 1-5. For more details, check out The CS109A Grade Questions on Graded Homework and Regrading Policy We take great care in making sure all homework are graded properly. However if you feel that your assignment was not fairly graded you may: Contact the grader by emailing the helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" within 48 hours of the grade release . If still unhappy with the initial response, then submit a reason via email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Second request\" within 2 days of receiving the initial response. Note: once regrading is done, you may receive a grade that is higher or lower than the initial grade. Collaboration Policy We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students (and on Piazza), but you are not allowed to look at any other students assignment or code outside of your pair. Discussion is encouraged, copying is not allowed. Please refer to Academic Honesty in The CS109A Grade link above Late Day Policy Homework is due on Tuesdays. You are allowed 1 late day per homework for a total of 5 late days. Communication from Staff to Students Class announcements will be through Canvas . All homework and quizzes will be posted and submitted in Canvas. Also all feedback forms. NOTE: make sure you have your settings set so you can receive emails from Canvas. Submitting an assignment Instructions for turning in assignments will be posted when the semester starts. Grading Score Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights: Homework 40% Quizzes 10% Project 50% Total 100% Software We will be using Jupyter Notebooks, Python 3 and various python modules. You can access the notebook viewer either in your own machine by installing the Anaconda platform (Links to an external site) which includes Jupyter/IPython as well all packages that will be required for the course, or by using the SEAS JupyterHub from Canvas. Details in class. Accommodations for students with disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential. Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to Academic Honesty section in The CS109A Grade link above Syllabus 2018.md Displaying Syllabus 2018.md.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"CS109a: Introduction to Data Science","text":"Fall 2018 Pavlos Protopapas and Kevin A.

Python experience is not a prerequisite for this course, as long as you are comfortable learning on your own as needed. Note though that the programming at the level of CS 50 is a prerequisite for this course. If you have concerns about the prerequisite, please come speak with any of the instructors. We will refer to the Python 3 documentation in this lab and throughout the course. There are also many introductory tutorials to help build programming skills, which we are listed in the last section of this lab. Table of Contents Learning Goals Getting Started Lists Simple Functions Numpy Scipy.stats and plotting distributions Conclusions Additional Stuff Dictionaries Reading CSVs using pandas Learning Goals This introductory lab is a condensed introduction to Python numerical programming. By the end of this lab, you will feel more comfortable: Writing short Python code using functions, loops, lists, numpy arrays, and dictionaries. Manipulating Python lists and numpy arrays and understanding the difference between them. Using probability distributions from scipy.stats Making very simple plots using matplotlib Reading and writing CSV files using pandas Learning and reading Python documentation. Lab 1 relates to material in lecture 0,1,2,3 and homework 0. Part 1: Getting Started Importing modules All notebooks should begin with code that imports modules , collections of built-in, commonly-used Python functions. Below we import the Numpy module, a fast numerical programming library for scientific computing. Future labs will require additional modules, which we'll import with the same import MODULE_NAME as MODULE_NICKNAME syntax. In [2]: import numpy as np #imports a fast numerical programming library Now that Numpy has been imported, we can access some useful functions. For example, we can use mean to calculate the mean of a set of numbers. In [3]: np . mean ([ 1.2 , 2 , 3.3 ]) to calculate the mean of 1.2, 2, and 3.3. The code above is not particularly efficient, and efficiency will be important for you when dealing with large data sets. Later and in lab 2 we will see more efficient options. Calculations and variables In [4]: # // is integer division 1 / 2 , 1 // 2 , 1.0 / 2.0 , 3 * 3.2 The last line in a cell is returned as the output value, as above. For cells with multiple lines of results, we can display results using print , as can be seen below. In [5]: print ( 1 + 3.0 , \" \\n \" , 9 , 7 ) 5 / 3 We can store integer or floating point values as variables. The other basic Python data types -- booleans, strings, lists -- can also be stored as variables. (more on types here: http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html ) In [6]: a = 1 b = 2.0 Here is the storing of a list (more about what a list is later): In [7]: a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] Think of a variable as a label for a value, not a box in which you put the value (image taken from Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho) In [8]: b = a b This DOES NOT create a new copy of a . It merely puts a new label on the memory at a, as can be seen by the following code: In [9]: print ( \"a\" , a ) print ( \"b\" , b ) a [ 1 ] = 7 print ( \"a after change\" , a ) print ( \"b after change\" , b ) Tuples Multiple items on one line in the interface are returned as a tuple , an immutable sequence of Python objects. In [10]: a = 1 b = 2.0 a + a , a - b , b * b , 10 * a We can obtain the type of a variable, and use boolean comparisons to test these types. In [11]: type ( a ) == float In [12]: type ( a ) == int For reference, below are common arithmetic and comparison operations. EXERCISE**: Create a tuple called `tup` with the following seven objects: . The first element is an integer of your choice The second element is a float of your choice The third element is the sum of the first two elements The fourth element is the difference of the first two elements The fifth element is first element divided by the second element Display the output of tup . What is the type of the variable tup ? What happens if you try and chage an item in the tuple? In [13]: # your code here Part 2: Lists Much of Python is based on the notion of a list. In Python, a list is a sequence of items separated by commas, all within square brackets. The items can be integers, floating points, or another type. Unlike in C arrays, items in a Python list can be different types, so Python lists are more versatile than traditional arrays in C or in other languages. Let's start out by creating a few lists. In [14]: empty_list = [] float_list = [ 1. , 3. , 5. , 4. , 2. ] int_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] mixed_list = [ 1 , 2. , 3 , 4. , 5 ] print ( empty_list ) print ( int_list ) print ( mixed_list , float_list ) Lists in Python are zero-indexed, as in C. The first entry of the list has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. In [15]: print ( int_list [ 0 ]) print ( float_list [ 1 ]) What happens if we try to use an index that doesn't exist for that list? Python will complain! In [16]: print ( float_list [ 10 ]) You can find the length of a list using the builtin function len : In [17]: print ( float_list ) len ( float_list ) Indexing on lists And since Python is zero-indexed, the last element of float_list is In [18]: float_list [ len ( float_list ) - 1 ] It is more idiomatic in python to use -1 for the last element, -2 for the second last, and so on In [19]: float_list [ - 1 ] We can use the : operator to access a subset of the list. This is called slicing. In [20]: print ( float_list [ 1 : 5 ]) print ( float_list [ 0 : 2 ]) Below is a summary of list slicing operations: You can slice \"backwards\" as well: In [21]: float_list [: - 2 ] # up to second last In [22]: float_list [: 4 ] # up to but not including 5th element You can also slice with a stride: In [23]: float_list [: 4 : 2 ] # above but skipping every second element We can iterate through a list using a loop. Here's a for loop. In [24]: for ele in float_list : print ( ele ) Or, if we like, we can iterate through a list using the indices using a for loop with in range . This is not idiomatic and is not recommended, but accomplishes the same thing as above. In [25]: for i in range ( len ( float_list )): print ( float_list [ i ]) What if you wanted the index as well? Use the built-in python method enumerate , which can be used to create a list of tuples with each tuple of the form (index, value) . In [26]: for i , ele in enumerate ( float_list ): print ( i , ele ) In [27]: # or make a list from it using the list constructor list ( enumerate ( float_list )) Appending and deleting We can also append items to the end of the list using the + operator or with append . In [28]: float_list + [ . 333 ] In [29]: float_list . append ( . 444 ) In [30]: print ( float_list ) len ( float_list ) Go and run the cell with float_list.append a second time. Then run the next line. What happens? To remove an item from the list, use del. In [31]: del ( float_list [ 2 ]) print ( float_list ) List Comprehensions Lists can be constructed in a compact way using a list comprehension . Here's a simple example. In [32]: squaredlist = [ i * i for i in int_list ] squaredlist And here's a more complicated one, requiring a conditional. In [33]: comp_list1 = [ 2 * i for i in squaredlist if i % 2 == 0 ] print ( comp_list1 ) This is entirely equivalent to creating comp_list1 using a loop with a conditional, as below: In [34]: comp_list2 = [] for i in squaredlist : if i % 2 == 0 : comp_list2 . append ( 2 * i ) print ( comp_list2 ) The list comprehension syntax [expression for item in list if conditional] is equivalent to the syntax for item in list: if conditional: expression Exercise: Build a list that contains every prime number between 1 and 100, in two different ways: Using for loops and conditional if statements. (Stretch Goal) Using a list comprehension. You should be able to do this in one line of code, and it may be helpful to look up the function all in the documentation. In [35]: # your code here In [36]: # your code here Part 4: Simple Functions A function object is a reusable block of code that does a specific task. Functions are all over Python, either on their own or on other objects. To invoke a function func , you call it as func(arguments) . We've seen built-in Python functions and methods. For example, len and print are built-in Python functions. And at the beginning, you called np.mean to calculate the mean of three numbers, where mean is a function in the numpy module and numpy was abbreviated as np . This syntax allows us to have multiple \"mean\" functions in different modules; calling this one as np.mean guarantees that we will pick up numpy's mean function, as opposed to a mean function from a different module. Methods A function that belongs to an object is called a method . By \"object\" here we mean an \"instance\" of a list, or integer, or floating point variable. An example of this is append on an existing list. In other words, a method is a function on an instance of a type of object (also called class , in this case, list type). In [37]: float_list = [ 1.0 , 2.09 , 4.0 , 2.0 , 0.444 ] print ( float_list ) float_list . append ( 56.7 ) float_list User-defined functions We'll now learn to write our own user-defined functions. Below is the syntax for defining a basic function with one input argument and one output. You can also define functions with no input or output arguments, or multiple input or output arguments. def name_of_function(arg): ... return(output) We can write functions with one input and one output argument. Here are two such functions. In [38]: def square ( x ): x_sqr = x * x return ( x_sqr ) def cube ( x ): x_cub = x * x * x return ( x_cub ) square ( 5 ), cube ( 5 ) What if you want to return two variables at a time? The usual way is to return a tuple: In [39]: def square_and_cube ( x ): x_cub = x * x * x x_sqr = x * x return ( x_sqr , x_cub ) square_and_cube ( 5 ) Lambda functions Often we quickly define mathematical functions with a one-line function called a lambda function. Lambda functions are great because they enable us to write functions without having to name them, ie, they're anonymous . No return statement is needed. In [40]: # create an anonymous function and assign it to the variable square square = lambda x : x * x print ( square ( 3 )) hypotenuse = lambda x , y : x * x + y * y ## Same as # def hypotenuse(x, y): # return(x*x + y*y) hypotenuse ( 3 , 4 ) Refactoring using functions In an exercise from Lab 0, you wrote code that generated a list of the prime numbers between 1 and 100. For the excercise below, it may help to revisit that code. Write a function called `isprime` that takes in a positive integer $N$, and determines whether or not it is prime. Return `True` if it's prime and return `False` if it isn't. Then, using a list comprehension and `isprime`, create a list `myprimes` that contains all the prime numbers less than 100. In [41]: # your code here Part 5: Introduction to Numpy Scientific Python code uses a fast array structure, called the numpy array. Those who have worked in Matlab will find this very natural. For reference, the numpy documention can be found here . Let's make a numpy array. In [42]: my_array = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]) my_array In [43]: # works as in lists len ( my_array ) The shape array of an array is very useful (we'll see more of it later when we talk about 2D and higher dimensional arrays). In [44]: my_array . shape Numpy arrays are typed . This means that by default, all the elements will be assumed to be of one type In [45]: my_array . dtype Numpy arrays are listy (i.e. they act like lists)! Below we compute length, slice, and iterate. In [46]: print ( len ( my_array )) print ( my_array [ 2 : 4 ]) for ele in my_array : print ( ele ) In general you should manipulate numpy arrays by using numpy module functions ( np.mean , for example). This is for efficiency purposes, and a discussion about this will happen in Lab2. You can calculate the mean of the array elements either by calling the method .mean on a numpy array or by applying the function np.mean with the numpy array as an argument. In [47]: print ( my_array . mean ()) print ( np . mean ( my_array )) The way we constructed the numpy array above seems redundant. After all we already had a regular python list. Indeed, it is the other ways we have to construct numpy arrays that make them super useful. There are many such numpy array constructors . Here are some commonly used constructors. Look them up in the documentation. In [48]: np . ones ( 10 ) # generates 10 floating point ones Numpy gains a lot of its efficiency from being typed. That is, all elements in the array have the same type, such as integer or floating point. The default type, as can be seen above, is a float of size appropriate for the machine (64 bit on a 64 bit machine). In [49]: np . dtype ( float ) . itemsize # in bytes In [50]: np . ones ( 10 , dtype = 'int' ) # generates 10 integer ones In [51]: np . zeros ( 10 ) Often you will want random numbers. Use the random constructor! In [52]: np . random . random ( 10 ) # uniform on [0,1] You can generate random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1: In [53]: normal_array = np . random . randn ( 1000 ) print ( \"The sample mean and standard devation are %f and %f , respectively.\" % ( np . mean ( normal_array ), np . std ( normal_array ))) You can sample with and without replacement from an array. Lets first construct a grid: In [54]: grid = np . arange ( 0. , 1.01 , 0.1 ) grid Without replacement In [55]: np . random . choice ( grid , 5 , replace = False ) In [56]: np . random . choice ( grid , 20 , replace = False ) With replacement: In [57]: np . random . choice ( grid , 12 , replace = True ) Numpy supports vector operations What does this mean? It means that instead of adding two arrays, element by element, you can just say: add the two arrays. Note that this behavior is very different from python lists. In [58]: first = np . ones ( 5 ) second = np . ones ( 5 ) first + second In [59]: first_list = [ 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. ] second_list = [ 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. ] first_list + second_list #not what u want On some computer chips this addition actually happens in parallel, so speedups can be high. But even on regular chips, the advantage of greater readability is important. Numpy supports a concept known as broadcasting , which dictates how arrays of different sizes are combined together. There are too many rules to list here, but importantly, multiplying an array by a number multiplies each element by the number. Adding a number adds the number to each element. In [60]: first + 1 In [61]: first * 5 This means that if you wanted the distribution $N(5, 7)$ you could do: In [62]: normal_5_7 = 5 + 7 * normal_array np . mean ( normal_5_7 ), np . std ( normal_5_7 ) Multiplying two arrays multiplies them element-by-element In [63]: ( first + 1 ) * ( first * 5 ) You might have wanted to compute the dot product instead: In [64]: np . dot (( first + 1 ) , ( first * 5 )) You can also use the @ operator for this purpose In [65]: ( first + 1 ) @ ( first * 5 ) Part 6: Probabilitiy Distributions from scipy.stats Since we'll be using many distributions, we'll want to access the pdf/pmf functions of these distributions and obtain samples from them. We already saw how to obtain samples from the continuous uniform and normal distributions. But we might want to obtain their pdfs as well. scipy.stats allows us to obtain the pdf function as well as samples. The programming interface is identical for all the distributions. To plot samples from and the pdfs of these distributions, we'll first import matplotlib , python's plotting library. The %matplotlib inline incantation ensures that plots are rendered inline in the browser. In [66]: % matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Lets get the normal distribution namespace from scipy.stats . Docs here . In [67]: from scipy.stats import norm Lets create 1000 points between -10 and 10 In [68]: x = np . linspace ( - 10 , 10 , 1000 ) x [: 10 ], x [ - 10 :] Lets get the pdf of a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and standard deviation 3 and plot it using the grid points computed before... In [69]: pdf_x = norm . pdf ( x , 1 , 3 ) plt . plot ( x , pdf_x ); And you can get random variables using the rvs function. In [70]: norm . rvs ( size = 30 , loc = 1 , scale = 3 ) We can use a more instance based way of getting both the pdf and samples. The documentation calls this instance a \"frozen\" distribution: In [71]: frozen_norm = norm ( loc = 1 , scale = 3 ) type ( frozen_norm ) In [72]: plt . plot ( x , frozen_norm . pdf ( x )) In [73]: frozen_norm . rvs ( 10 ) We can now plot a histogram of the samples using matplotlib: (see docs on plt.hist by typing ?plt.hist in a cell by itself) In [74]: plt . hist ( frozen_norm . rvs ( 1000 ), bins = 30 ); By default the histogram gives us counts. We can re-normalize these counts to get an approximation to the probability distribution from the samples. In [75]: plt . hist ( frozen_norm . rvs ( 1000 ), bins = 30 , normed = True ); Part 7: Conclusions For more practice exercises (with solutions) and discussion, see this page . Some of these exercises are particularly relevant. Check them out! Don't forget to look up Jake's book . Finally, we would like to suggest using Chris Albon's web site as a reference. Lots of useful information there. Additional Stuff Part 1: Dictionaries A dictionary is another storage container. Like a list, a dictionary is a sequence of items. Unlike a list, a dictionary is unordered and its items are accessed with keys and not integer positions. Dictionaries are the closest container we have to a database. Let's make a dictionary with a few Harvard courses and their corresponding enrollment numbers. In [76]: enroll2017_dict = { 'CS50' : 692 , 'CS109A / Stat 121A / AC 209A' : 352 , 'Econ1011a' : 95 , 'AM21a' : 153 , 'Stat110' : 485 } enroll2017_dict One can obtain the value corrsponding to a key thus: In [77]: enroll2017_dict [ 'CS50' ] Or thus, which allows for the key to not be in the dictionary In [78]: enroll2017_dict . get ( 'CS01' , 5 ), enroll2017_dict . get ( 'CS01' ) In [79]: enroll2017_dict . get ( 'CS50' ) All sorts of iterations are supported: In [80]: enroll2017_dict . values () In [81]: enroll2017_dict . items () We can iterate over the tuples obtained above: (to read more about how the print formatting works , look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting and https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html ) In [82]: for key , value in enroll2017_dict . items (): print ( \" %s : %d \" % ( key , value )) Simply iterating over a dictionary gives us the keys. This is useful when we want to do something with each item: In [83]: second_dict = {} for key in enroll2017_dict : second_dict [ key ] = enroll2017_dict [ key ] second_dict The above is an actual copy to another part of memory, unlike, second_dict = enroll2017_dict which would have made both variables label the same memory location. In this example, the keys were strings corresponding to course names. Keys don't have to be strings though. Like lists, you can construct dictionaries using a dictionary comprehension , which is similar to a list comprehension. Notice the brackets {} and the use of zip , which is another iterator that combines two lists together. In [84]: my_dict = { k : v for ( k , v ) in zip ( int_list , float_list )} my_dict You can also create dictionaries using the constructor function dict . In [85]: dict ( a = 1 , b = 2 ) Part 2: Introduction to Pandas Often data is stored in comma separated values (CSV) files. For the remainder of this lab, we'll be working with automobile data , where we've extracted relevant parts below. Note that CSV files can be output by any spreadsheet software, and are plain text, hence are a great way to share data. Importing data with pandas Now let's read in our automobile data as a pandas dataframe structure. In [86]: import pandas as pd In [87]: # Read in the csv files dfcars = pd . read_csv ( \"data/mtcars.csv\" ) type ( dfcars ) In [88]: dfcars . head () What we have now is a spreadsheet with indexed rows and named columns, called a dataframe in pandas. dfcars is an instance of the pd.DataFrame class , created by calling the pd.read_csv \"constructor function\". The take-away is that dfcars is a dataframe object, and it has methods (functions) belonging to it. For example, df.head() is a method that shows the first 5 rows of the dataframe. A pandas dataframe is a set of columns pasted together into a spreadsheet, as shown in the schematic below, which is taken from the cheatsheet above. The columns in pandas are called series objects. Let's look again at the first five rows of dfcars . In [89]: dfcars . head () Notice the poorly named first column: \"Unnamed: 0\". Why did that happen? The first column, which seems to be the name of the car, does not have a name. Here are the first 3 lines of the file: \"\",\"mpg\",\"cyl\",\"disp\",\"hp\",\"drat\",\"wt\",\"qsec\",\"vs\",\"am\",\"gear\",\"carb\" \"Mazda RX4\",21,6,160,110,3.9,2.62,16.46,0,1,4,4 \"Mazda RX4 Wag\",21,6,160,110,3.9,2.875,17.02,0,1,4,4 Lets clean that up: In [90]: dfcars = dfcars . rename ( columns = { \"Unnamed: 0\" : \"name\" }) dfcars . head () In the above, the argument columns = {\"Unnamed: 0\": \"name\"} of rename changed the name of the first column in the dataframe from Unnamed: 0 to name . Lets save this cleaned dataframe out to a CSV file. In [91]: # dont store the 0,1,2,3,4.. index dfcars . to_csv ( \"data/cleaned-mtcars.csv\" , index = False , header = True ) The output will look something like this: name,mpg,cyl,disp,hp,drat,wt,qsec,vs,am,gear,carb Mazda RX4,21.0,6,160.0,110,3.9,2.62,16.46,0,1,4,4 Mazda RX4 Wag,21.0,6,160.0,110,3.9,2.875,17.02,0,1,4,4 Datsun 710,22.8,4,108.0,93,3.85,2.32,18.61,1,1,4,1 Hornet 4 Drive,21.4,6,258.0,110,3.08,3.215,19.44,1,0,3,1 Hornet Sportabout,18.7,8,360.0,175,3.15,3.44,17.02,0,0,3,2 Valiant,18.1,6,225.0,105,2.76,3.46,20.22,1,0,3,1 To access a series (column), you can use either dictionary syntax or instance-variable syntax. Dictionary syntax is very useful when column names have spaces: Python variables cannot have spaces in them. In [92]: dfcars . mpg In [93]: dfcars [ 'mpg' ] You can get a numpy array of values from the Pandas Series: In [94]: dfcars . mpg . values And we can produce a histogram from these values In [95]: # the .values isnt really need, a series behaves like a list for # plotting purposes plt . hist ( dfcars . mpg . values , bins = 20 ); plt . xlabel ( \"mpg\" ); plt . ylabel ( \"Frequency\" ) plt . title ( \"Miles per Gallon\" ); But pandas is very cool: you can get a histogram directly: In [96]: dfcars . mpg . hist ( bins = 20 ); plt . xlabel ( \"mpg\" ); plt . ylabel ( \"Frequency\" ) plt . title ( \"Miles per Gallon\" ); We can also get sub-dataframes by choosing a set of series. We pass a list of the columns we want as \"dictionary keys\" to the dataframe. In [97]: dfcars [[ 'am' , 'mpg' ]] Scatter plots We often want to see co-variation among our columns, for example, miles/gallon versus weight. This can be done with a scatter plot. In [98]: plt . scatter ( dfcars . wt , dfcars . mpg ); plt . xlabel ( \"weight\" ); plt . ylabel ( \"miles per gallon\" ); You could have used plot instead of scatter . In [99]: plt . plot ( dfcars . wt , dfcars . mpg , 'o' ); plt . xlabel ( \"weight\" ); plt . ylabel ( \"miles per gallon\" ); Usually we use plt.show() at the end of every plot to display the plot. Our magical incantation %matplotlib inline takes care of this for us, and we don't have to do it in the Jupyter notebook. But if you run your Python program from a file, you will need to explicitly have a call to show. We include it for completion. In [100]: plt . plot ( dfcars . wt , dfcars . mpg , 'ko' ) #black dots plt . xlabel ( \"weight\" ); plt . ylabel ( \"miles per gallon\" ); plt . show () Suppose we'd like to save a figure to a file. We do this by including the savefig command in the same cell as the plotting commands. The file extension tells you how the file will be saved. In [101]: plt . plot ( dfcars . wt , dfcars . mpg , 'o' ) plt . xlabel ( \"weight\" ); plt . ylabel ( \"miles per gallon\" ); plt . savefig ( 'images/foo1.pdf' ) plt . savefig ( 'images/foo1.png' , bbox_inches = 'tight' ) #less whitespace around image And this is what the saved png looks like. Code in Markdown to show this is: ![](images/foo1.png) Below is a summary of the most commonly used matplotlib plotting routines. Exercise Create a scatter plot showing the co-variation between two columns of your choice. Label the axes. See if you can do this without copying and pasting code from earlier in the lab. What can you conclude, if anything, from your scatter plot?
